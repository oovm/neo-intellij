# Neo Changelog

## [0.2.0]
### Fixed
- Fix the problem that bnf keywords are not highlighted ([#1](https://github.com/oovm/neo-intellij/pull/1))

### Changed

- XML & HTML elements use <span style="color:#E5C17C">Structure Color</span>
- XML & HTML attributes use <span style="color:#F07178">Field Color</span>

By default, html element is a keyword, that has a certain truth.

But considering the consistency with jsx and tsx, it is more appropriate to treat it as a structure

## [0.1.0]
### Added
- Neo Light: Based on atom one light
- Neo Night: Based on atom one dark
